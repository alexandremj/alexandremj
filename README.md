Coding since 2016. Worked with C, C++, Java, Javascript on past projects. Python is my main language, mostly used for scraping and data analysis. Consider working with backend development on the future

Currently starting a Data Science carrer, at first interested on scikit-learn and familiarization with pandas

Other areas of interest include Algorithms and Software Engineering with a focus on Agile Development

☕ On my coffee breaks I like discussing the impact of technologies on society. My graduation work is being developed around the impacts of disinformation (specially fake news) on COVID-19 spread in Brazil

Looking for data projects I can test stuff on 🚀

By accident became a distro-hopper. Ran at some point and with varying durations most Ubuntu versions since 16.04, Manjaro, Antergos (R.I.P.), Arch and Pop_OS (all versions since 19.04). Currently running Debian 11 with KDE on my laptop in a FOSS-only install and Manjaro i3 on the desktop (until I get some free time to standardize both installs)
